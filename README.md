## Project Overview
The Interactive Quiz and Skill Assessment App is a fully functional browser based web application built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project focuses on core frontend engineering concepts such as DOM manipulation, event driven programming, and client side state management without using any frameworks or libraries.
The application allows users to select a topic, attempt a timed quiz, receive instant results, and store their attempts using browser storage.

## Problem Statement
Students often rely on static learning resources that do not provide real time evaluation or feedback. As a result, it becomes difficult to measure understanding and track learning progress.
This project addresses that problem by providing an interactive quiz platform that dynamically renders questions, evaluates user responses, calculates scores, and maintains progress on the client side.
